**Ask your data. Trust the answer.**

A text-to-SQL product for non-technical users. Connect any SQL database, ask
questions in plain English, get answers with a plain-English explanation and a
confidence level. Every answer you confirm teaches it your database — accuracy
improves with use.

**📚 Full documentation lives in [`docs/`](docs/README.md)** — written for
non-technical readers, with code pointers for developers at every step.

## Quick Start (Docker)

The easiest and recommended way to run BoloDB is using Docker. This ensures all services (FastAPI Backend, SvelteKit Frontend, Nginx, and MongoDB) run seamlessly.

1. Install [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) (Windows/Mac) or Docker Engine (Linux).
2. Open a terminal in the project directory.
3. Start the application:
   ```bash
   docker compose up -d
   ```
4. Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) in your browser.
5. Add your Gemini API key, connect a database (or click "Try with sample data"), and start asking!

## The AI engine

BoloDB uses **Google Gemini** for all AI operations. You only need one thing:
a Gemini API key — there's a free tier, and it takes about a minute:

1. Go to https://aistudio.google.com/apikey (sign in with any Google account).
2. Click **Create API key** and copy it.
3. Paste it into BoloDB on the connect screen (or later in Settings).

Deployments can instead set the `GEMINI_API_KEY` environment variable.

| Model (pick in Settings) | Best for |
|---|---|
| `gemini-2.5-flash-lite` | Cheapest & fastest — small, simple databases |
| `gemini-2.5-flash` (default) | Best cost/accuracy balance for most uses |
| `gemini-2.5-pro` | Most accurate — large schemas, hard questions |

**Privacy:** only your database *structure* (table/column names, a few sample
values) and your question are sent to Google — never the rows in your tables.
See [docs/03-the-ai-layer-gemini.md](docs/03-the-ai-layer-gemini.md) for
exactly what's in every prompt.

## Database connection strings

| Database | Format |
|---|---|
| SQLite | `sqlite:///C:/path/to/file.db` |
| PostgreSQL | `postgresql://user:pass@host:5432/dbname` |
| MySQL | `mysql+pymysql://user:pass@host:3306/dbname` |
| SQL Server | `mssql+pyodbc://user:pass@server/db?driver=ODBC+Driver+17+for+SQL+Server` |

Tip: connect with a **read-only database account** for safety (BoloDB also
enforces read-only itself — see
[docs/05-safety-validation-and-self-repair.md](docs/05-safety-validation-and-self-repair.md)).

## How it works

1. **Connect** a database and add your Gemini API key
2. **Onboard** (first time) — BoloDB profiles the tables, confirms business-term meanings with you, and runs a few starter questions for you to verify
3. **Ask** questions in plain English. Every answer includes:
   - A plain-English restatement ("I summed completed orders for this month")
   - A confidence level (High/Medium/Low) based on real signals
   - The results table and SQL on a toggle
   - Automatic self-repair: generated SQL is validated against your schema and fixed before you ever see an error
4. **Verify** — click "Yes, correct" to save the answer. Similar future questions reuse it and show higher confidence. The trust level climbs from Supervised to Assisted to Trusted

## Useful Docker Commands

```bash
docker compose up -d           # Start the application in the background
docker compose logs -f         # View live logs from all services
docker compose down            # Stop all services
docker compose build --no-cache # Rebuild all images from scratch
```

## Running tests

```bash
pip install -r backend/requirements.txt
pytest tests
```

The test suite needs no network and no API key — all AI calls are faked.

## Privacy

- All learned knowledge and user settings are stored locally (`~/.bolodb/`) and in the local MongoDB container volume.
- Only the schema and your question are sent to the AI to generate SQL — never your row data.
- Queries run strictly read-only.
- No telemetry, no cloud sync.
